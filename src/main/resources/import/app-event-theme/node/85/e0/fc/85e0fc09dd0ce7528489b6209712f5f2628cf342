There are a number of theories about this. To clarify, while the increase may be exaggerated by people who falsely claim intolerance when they probably have other health issues (or are hypochondriacs), there is actually an increase in people with diagnosable gluten intolerance. And gluten intolerance is different than celiac. I'm taking here about gluten intolerance. Some possible causes include changes in the gut microbiome and changes in how we process and make bread.</p>\n\n<p>Changes in the gut microbiome are a likely cause/contributor but the causes and effects of that are just stating to be understood, and barely. So I won't go into that too much, but if anyone has questions I may be able to answer.</p>\n\n<p>On the processing side, one interesting theory is that the germ of wheat helps us process the gluten in some way. It has lots of nutrients, vitamins, fats, etc. Modern wheat flour (even most whole grain stuff) is made by separating the germ from the rest of the wheat first, then processing. This causes the flour to keep longer but removes all those nutrients. This is why flour/cereals need to be fortified. However, we only fortify with the vitamins and minerals for which we notice obvious deficiencies. So it's entirely feasible that we are neglecting to add something back into the flour that helps SOME people not develop gluten intolerance. This may be via some immune response or due to changes caused in the gut microbe (e.g. we are no longer giving some micronutrients to a specific bacteria in our gut so it dies out. That bacteria helped us process gluten or a byproduct and without its help we get sick). It's also possible that our body just needs some nutrient in the germ to process gluten efficiently. We really just don't know.</p>\n"}]}]},{"set":[{"name":"question","type":"String","values":[{"v":"Do donated organs age  to  donors age?"}]},{"name":"answer","type":"String","values":[{"v":"<p>I haven’t seen anyone mention the fact that once inside the recipient the donated organ will be under constant attack from the recipients immune system, which will prematurely age the organ.

It’s a balancing act between suppressing the immune system enough to stave off rejection of the new organ (which is almost always inevitable) and having enough of an immune system to fight off basic infections.

For rare diseases that pop up now and then, like ebola, this was important because people wanted to know where ebola was coming from.

After finding out \"patient zero\" for ebola outbreaks, you can look at where they lived, what they did, etc. to identify likely candidates for animal hosts, and then go into the wild and collect those animals to see if they actually have the virus. If they do, then you can now warn everyone that this is how you get ebola, so they know to be cautious.</p>\n\n<p>Studying diseases that can jump species barriers can also potentially teach us about which diseases might do this in the future, so we can be prepared just in case it happens.</p>\n\n<p>If&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;little is known about the disease in question, tracing the path of transmission can tell you how the disease is spreading.

Does it even spread from person to person, or were all those infected exposed to the same source, rather than one passing it to the other? Legionnaire's disease is like this, it DOES NOT spread from person to person, it spreads through inhaling contaminated water vapor.
